      <description>i mean completely new guys, without any programing background
i asked this question at linkedin, and one answer was that Go is to hard and beginners should start with python or java&amp;hellip;
i thought about it too &amp;hellip; and i think this is just our opinion (programmers with experience), because go has a bit of different concepts than java/python, and they seem more difficult, but they are just different, and if someone will start learning he needs to understand Go approach&amp;hellip; that`s all :D</description>
